# dog-dating-app

## Description

Snif was created to help owners find companions for their dogs. While many people find connections using dating apps, why not expand this to pets? Snif allows owners to set up a profile for their dog and then get to "swiping" through potential matches.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

When the user first loads Snif, they will be prompted to either login or sign up. To sign up the user will need to provide an email, their name, and a password that meets the given requirements. When signed up, the user will be directed to the Profile page where they can set up a profile for their dog. They will be able to fill in their dog's name, breed, age, size and bio. The user can also upload a photo of their dog. Once this is complete, the user can go to the Home page and view potential matches. Clicking the green check mark adds the dog to their "Likes" and will await a "Match". When a "Match" is made, the user can then click on the Chat tab, to communicate futher with this dog's owner.
